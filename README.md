Image carousel

Image carousels are very common across various types of websites, including online stores, news sites, and many more. They’re great for advertising, showcasing things, showing several things using limited screen size, and can actually be made using things you’ve already learned! They are also highly customizable - you can make them auto-scroll, allow users to manually cycle between slides, skip to certain slides, etc.

Typically, they consist of a div that acts as the “picture frame”, where behind that div, there is another much wider div containing the carousel’s images. This strip of images can then move behind the picture frame, showing a different image depending on what part of the strip is visible. Any additional controls or features can then be placed on top of the entire thing.
